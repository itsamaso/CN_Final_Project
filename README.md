The application data transferring system is based on RDT's Stop-And-Wait operation. However, without its pipelined protocols. An unreliable channel was assumed, and turned into a realiable channel over UDP. Therefore, timeouts had its default value: "0.125". Regarding GUI, it was implemented with Tkinter._
