## Computer Networking Definition:
_A computer network is a set of computers sharing resources located on or provided by network nodes. The computers use common communication protocols over digital interconnections to communicate with each other. These interconnections are made up of telecommunication network technologies, based on physically wired, optical, and wireless radio-frequency methods that may be arranged in a variety of network topologies._

## Overview:
  _In this repository, we will be showing a basic chatting application that was built according to the principles of reliable data transfer.
  The application was developed in Python and PyCharm was our IDE. We have managed to implement synchronization in order to maintain a well-synchronized data transferring among users. The application data transferring system is based on RDT's Stop-And-Wait operation. However, without its pipelined protocols. An unreliable channel was assumed, and turned into a realiable channel over UDP. Therefore, timeouts had its default value: "0.125". Regarding GUI, it was implemented with Tkinter._
  
## Wiki Pages:
  _An elaborative wiki has been setup for you. It clarifies how our application runs and the way it works.
  It consists of the following pages:_
